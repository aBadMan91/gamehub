# GameHub - Year One Project - Noroff

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aBadMan91/gamehub/main/images/GameHubHomeScreenshotReadme.jpg)

The first project I worked on at Noroff.

## Description

This was my first project from Year 1 Front-end development at Noroff.
I made a website for a online gamestore named "GameHub".

We were not allowed to use any frameworks, at first we made only a static version of the website, and that's the reason only one game is working when you click on the games.
At a later date we were tasked to update the website to be more dynamic with fetching the games from an API call, this API was from the "WordPress Rest API", we used the "WooCommerce" plugin for the products.

I didn't add the API version to the live version because I didn't own any domain at the time, that version (cms) was only made in a local WordPress.

There are two different versions:

- Static version
- API call version

The static version (main) is the one that is linked here, and the API call version (cms) is the newest, but only a local api call.
